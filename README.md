# Sleep efficiency Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the python code and documentation for analyzing the "salary" dataset using
 Python and statistical methods. The dataset consists of various variables related to Sleep duration, sleep efficiency, REM sleep
percentage, deep sleep percentage, light sleep percentage, awakenings, caffeine, algohol consumption.
Our goal is to explore, analyze, and draw insights from this data.

## Dataset Description
The "Salary" dataset contains information about Sleep efficiency and duration of individuals. Each entry represents a unique 
dining experience and includes the following columns:

- **ID**: Identification number for each individual in the dataset.
- **Age**: Age of the individuals in the dataset.
- **Gender**: Gender of the individuals (e.g., male, female).
- **Sleep duration**: Total duration of sleep in a specified time period.
- **Sleep efficiency**: The effectiveness of sleep, often measured as the ratio of actual sleep time to the total time spent in bed, expressed as a percentage.
- **REM sleep percentage**: The proportion of total sleep time spent in REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, expressed as a percentage.
- **Deep sleep percentage**: The proportion of total sleep time spent in deep sleep stages, expressed as a percentage.
- **Light sleep percentage**: The proportion of total sleep time spent in light sleep stages, expressed as a percentage.
- **Awakenings**: The number of times an individual wakes up during the sleep period.
- **Caffeine consumption**: Amount of caffeine consumed by individuals, possibly within a specified time frame.
- **Alcohol consumption**: Amount of alcohol consumed by individuals, possibly within a specified time frame.
- **Smoking status**: The smoking habits of individuals (e.g., smoker, non-smoker).
- **Exercise frequency**: The frequency at which individuals engage in exercise or physical activity.
